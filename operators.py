# is 	Returns True if both variables are the same object	x is y	
# is not	Returns True if both variables are not the same object	x is not y

# in 	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	x in y	
# not in	Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	x not in y
